# Copy tur-request.sh to /glftpd/bin. Make it executable (755). #
# Copy tur-request.conf to /glftpd/bin (same dir as .sh).       #
#                                                               #
# Copy either tur-request.no_auth.tcl OR tur-request.auth.tcl   #
# to your bot's scripts dir and load it in the bot's config     #
# file. Which one you choose depends on whether or not you want #
# to use the authentication system in tur-request.              #
# See the AUTH_SYSTEM setting in tur-request.conf for more info.#
# Edit your selected tcl and change any triggers if you dont    #
# like the default settings. Take note of my mad Tcl skillz =)  #
#                                                               #
# If you use Linux, copy file_date to your glftpd's bin dir.    #
# Otherwise, the source is included as well. This is ONLY for   #
# deleting old filled requests automatically. If you do not     #
# want to use this, set 'removefdays' to "" in the config.      #
# To compile the source: gcc -o file_date file_date.c           #
#                                                               #
# Some of the binaries you need in /glftpd/bin are:             #
# basename, egrep, rmdir, cat, grep, touch, file_date, tr and   #
# some standard ones...                                         #
# If you are going to use the reward system, you need tuls as   #
# well. Thats a separate package available at www.grandis.nu    #
#                                                               #
# Edit tur-request.conf and change the settings.                #
# Make REAL sure to read the explanations in the config. I      #
# don't take any responsibility for it deleting stuff.          #

# To make this mofo announce, We need to add some things.       #
# If you are using the old Dark0n3's zipscript, the following   #
# goes to dZSbot.tcl.                                           #
# If you are using pzs-ng, it goes into ngBot.conf              #
# Note: If you are using a newer version of pzs-ng, you do not  #
#       need to do anything. TURGEN is already in the new       #
#       versions. Forgot exact build, but its in 1.0.1811 for   #
#       sure. Skip these instructions if so.                    #
#                                                               #
# Note: Depending on version, set msgtypes(DEFAULT) might not   #
#       exist in ngBot.conf. If so, find it in                  #
#       ngBot.conf.defaults, copy it into ngBot.conf and        #
#       then add TURGEN to set msgtypes(DEFAULT) in ngBot.conf  #
#                                                               #
# Check first that TURGEN isn't already added. It's used for a  #
# few other scripts as well.                                    #
#                                                               #
# To 'set msgtypes(DEFAULT)', add TURGEN                        #
#                                                               #
# Add the following in the appropriate places:                  #
#--                                                           --#
# set chanlist(TURGEN) "#YourChan"
#
# set disable(TURGEN) 0
#
# set variables(TURGEN) "%msg"
#
# If you are using Dark0n3's dZSbot.tcl, this goes to dZSbot.tcl 
# as well:                                                      
# set announce(TURGEN)  "%msg"
#
# If, however, you are using pzs-ng (beta3 or higher), then
# this goes to your current .zst theme file:
# announce.TURGEN = "%msg"
#                                                             --#

# To make it announce when using SiteStat5, simply replace      #
# TURGEN: with RAW: in all occurrences of the .conf and the     #
# .sh. Nothing more should be required.                         #

# To automatically display current requests when a user goes    #
# into your requests dir, edit glftpd.conf and put .requests    #
# in the show_diz field. Example:                               #
# show_diz file_id.diz .message .imdb .requests                 #

# If you want to hide the .requests file, so that users cannot  #
# edit or destroy it, edit glftpd.conf and put .requests on the #
# hidden_files field. Example:                                  #
# hidden_files .journal lost+found requests                     #
# Yes, it will still be displayed when entering the dir and     #
# users CAN still modify it, just not see it. Helps a bit.      #
# This is REALLY important to do in case you have the reward    #
# system enabled, as it will be really easy to manually add a   #
# reward to the request otherwise.                              #
#                                                               #

# If you want to force users to use this script and NOT create  #
# dirs directly in the requests dir, add this to glftpd.conf:   #
# makedir /site/REQUESTS/*/ 1                                   #
# Change the path to suit your setup of course.                 #
#                                                               #

# The commands are request, reqfilled, status, reqwipe, reqdel, #
# fix and checkold.                                             #

# reqdel is used to delete your own requests. It will check if  #
# the username that's trying to reqdel is the same as the one   #
# doing the request.                                            #

# Siteops should instead use 'reqwipe' to delete other          #
# people's requests.                                            #
# This is needed because you can not reqfill an empty request   #
# and you might want to remove your request.                    #
#                                                               #

# If you run 'tur-request.sh status auto', it will check if     #
# there are any requests and if so, announce it to the channel. #
# If there are no requests, it will just quit. This is if you   #
# want a reminder in irc of all the requests from time to time. #
# You can just crontab it to do 'status auto' whenever you like.#
# So add this to crontab to announce all requests at 18:01.     #

# If you want it to automatically delete old requests, crontab  #
# the 'checkold' command whenever you like.                     #
# It will delete both unfilled requests and filled ones,        #

# When requesting, you can specify who the request is for.      #
# Simply add -for:username to the request and this will show in #

# When requesting, you can add a reward for the filling of the  #

# anywhere in the command.                                      #

# If you do not want it to announce in the main channel when    #

# but it wouldn't work very well. First of all, zipscript-c     #
# doesn't return the full path, only filename. I can get around #
# it by checking xferlog for where that file is. But what if a  #
# req has 2 CD's? When first was filled, it would reqfill the   #
# dir. So, won't add that right now. You're free to make a      #
# working complete script as an addon for this and I'll gladly  #
# add it.                                                       #
